# Release Please - Automatic version bumping based on conventional commits
# - feat: commits → bump minor version (0.x.0)
# - fix: commits → bump patch version (0.0.x)
# - BREAKING CHANGE: → bump major version (x.0.0)
#
# How it works:
# 1. You push commits with conventional format (feat:, fix:, etc.)
# 2. Release-please creates a "Release PR" with changelog
# 3. When you merge the Release PR, it creates a GitHub release with tag
# 4. The tag triggers release.yml to build binaries
